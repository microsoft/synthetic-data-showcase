Indicates whether attribute combination counts of already-synthesized records should influence the subsequent behaviour of the sampling process:

- If **No**: the sampling process will take into account only the reported aggregate counts to balance the sampling process

- If **Yes**: the sampling process will take into account both the reported aggregate counts and the already-synthesized counts to balance the sampling process
